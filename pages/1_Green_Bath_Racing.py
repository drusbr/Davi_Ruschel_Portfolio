# ---- INTRO ----
st.info("""
Green Bath Racing is a student engineering team focused on developing ultra-efficient prototype vehicles.  
In 2025 the team achieved **4th place in Europe & North Africa** and set a new **UK efficiency record (835 km/kWh)**.  
This success was driven by advances in data systems, simulation, and strategy optimisation â€” areas I directly contributed to.

# ---- ROLE ----
st.subheader("My Contribution")
st.markdown("""
I joined the team in my third year, initially as a **Data & Telemetry Engineer**, before expanding into **Simulation & Strategy Development**.  
My work centred on creating tools to **capture, process, and apply data in real time** to improve team performance.

    st.markdown("""
    - **Objective**: Optimise vehicle efficiency using a simulation-driven approach.  
    - **Tools**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Streamlit.  
    - **Key Tasks**:  
        â€¢ Built a probabilistic simulation tool modelling vehicle dynamics, energy use, and acceleration strategy  
        â€¢ Created a logic-based random strategy generator with constraints (cornering, acceleration zones)  
        â€¢ Developed a two-lap evaluation framework to test strategy repeatability  
        â€¢ Conducted sensitivity analysis on factors such as motor efficiency and track gradient  
        â€¢ Presented findings to the team and adjusted strategies during live competition  
    - **Impact**: Improved efficiency progressively from **600 â†’ 787 km/kWh** in practice runs, then to **835 km/kWh** in official runs, setting a new national record.
